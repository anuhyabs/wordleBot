# wordleBot

Wordle is a web based word game that soared in popularity in 2022 and is currently owned and published by New York Times.
The challenge of the game is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts.
Each time guess is made, the player is informed which of the chosen letters are in the target word.
- The color green indicates that the letter is in the right position.
- The color yellow indicates that the letter exists in the target word but is not in the right position.
- The color black/grey indicates that letter does not exist in the target word.
Thatâ€™s it!

In the project wordleBot, we create a Python package that can find an optimised solution for the given Wordle (optimistically in the first attempt)using the â¬›ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ© tweet distribution.
This is done by simulations of hypothetical games and comparing the feedback received with data from Twitter by ranking a word based on cosine similarity. 
The inspiration for this project is this excellent [Ben Hammerâ€™s Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/wordle-1-6).
